# Tableau Project-Online Sales Data

## Overview

Visualization of online retail sales data with Tableau

## Business Task

To visualize the dataset on Tableau to observe trends and gain insight into the sales of each item and the revenue generated. Visualizing the dataset makes it easy to present the information in the dataset to business leaders so they can use the knowledge to improve their operations and grow their profit.

## Data Source

I obtained the online retail sales data of an ecommerce store on Kaggle, and it can be found here and cleaned it using MySQL Workbench. The details of me cleaning the dataset can be found here.

## Tools

Tableau

## Process

* I opened Tableau and imported the CSV file containing the clean online retail sales data.

* On the first sheet, I created a map showing all the countries where the ecommerce company is actively in business. Most sales were generated in the United Kingdom. The visual of the map makes it easy to see each active country and the revenue it generated.

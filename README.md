# Tableau Project-Online Sales Data

## Overview

Visualization of online retail sales data with Tableau

## Business Task

To visualize the dataset on Tableau to observe trends and gain insight into the sales of each item and the revenue generated. Visualizing the dataset makes it easy to present the information in the dataset to business leaders so they can use the knowledge to improve their operations and grow their profit.

## Data Source

I obtained the online retail sales data of an ecommerce store on Kaggle, and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerkk12/online-retail-business) and cleaned it using MySQL Workbench. The details of me cleaning the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/jefferyokpala/MySQL-Project-Ecommerce-Online-Sales).

## Tool

Tableau

## Process

* I opened Tableau and imported the CSV file containing the clean online retail sales data.

* On the first sheet, I created a map showing all the countries where the ecommerce company is actively in business. Most sales were generated in the United Kingdom. The visual of the map makes it easy to see each active country and the revenue it generated.

* In sheet 2, I visualized the revenue generated by country in circles, to give an easy demonstration of how much money the company is grossing in each active country.

* In sheet 3, I created a bar chart visualizing the sales revenue per month and observed that the ecommerce company generated the most revenue by far in November (~$1,500,000). The next three months were October, September, and December. This means that sales are highest during the holiday months, and the ecommerce company should have enough inventory and staff for the delivery logistics. They can also engage in more holiday promotions to boost sales further.

* In sheet 4, I created a bar chart visualizing the revenue that the ecommerce company makes per day to know the day of the week that the business brings in the most money. From the bar chart below, the data shows that most revenue came on Thursdays from 99,570 sales of different items. The least revenue is generated on Sundays, followed by Fridays. I believe this means that customers buy more items online during the weekdays and go shopping in person during the weekends. To generate more weekend sales, the company should run weekend promotional offers and offer vouchers for weekend sales that can be redeemed during weekday sales.

* In Sheet 5, I wanted to see the revenue trend per month so I created a line chart to visualize that. The chart showed that revenue was more or less the same from January to August. Revenue spiked in September through November but dipped in December. This suggests that people were shopping in preparation for the holiday season.

* In Sheet 6, I created a chart to find out the time of day during which customers shop the most and least. The visual showed that shoppers were most active in the afternoon and least active in the evening. My instinct leads me to believe that most people shop in the morning and afternoon so their orders can be delivered as soon as possible. Evening shoppers are likely people who did not find time to do so during the day. However, to increase evening sales, the ecommerce company can run time-sensitive promotional campaigns that reward evening shoppers.

* In sheet 7, I created a line chart to see how many customers shopped at the ecommerce store per month. I wanted to see the trend as the months went by to know if the store was gaining or losing customers. The trend I uncovered was similar to that of revenue in Sheet 5. The number of shoppers was more or less the same from January to August and grew from September to the end of the year. However, there was a dip in December, likely because people had already done their holiday shopping in November.

* I built the dashboard below with all this information for easy viewing and presentation. It gives an overview of all the important information in the dataset.
